#Welcome;Welcome to ideal - the Interactive Differential Expression Analysis tool that also enables reproducible analyses! Click on the 'next' button to proceed with the first interactive tour.
#ui_instructions;Here you can read the Instructions to learn the basics of ideal. If you click out of the intro-highlighted area, you are about to interrupt the tour. Don't worry, you can resume it anytime by re-clicking on the tour button. Once you are done with the first reading, you can move on to the next tab, where you will learn how to load your data.
#box_ddsobj;Up here you have three Info Boxes. The first is a summary for your DESeqDataSet object you will create soon...
#DataTab;In this tab you can upload your data. You basically need three mandatory steps, highlighted in these boxes, from red through yellow to green - with a couple of optional steps. Your expression count data need to be in tabular format, with identifiers as the first column and the sample names as headers - you should be fine with common outputs from featureCounts or HTSeq-count. The first basic tour ends here, click on 'Done' to exit and continue with the section-based tours.
